# CS 142 Lab 4

For this lab, we're switching to randomized partners!  Your pairing will be put up on the screen at the beginning of class.

## Self-Driving Racecars

In this lab, you will continue working on the racecar program from last week.  This lab will help you think critically about classes, programming structure, and design.

### Getting started

Partner up with your new partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file.  Make sure both partners submit the files and that there is an appropriate comment at the top of your files with your names and what/where you changed things in your code.
